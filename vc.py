"""
VerCon (VC)
-----------

A simple version control system for a single user.

Released under GPL v3.
(c) 2023 by Mathieu Br√®thes


Goals of the project:

- should not require any tool beyond Python and standard Python library
- basic version control : only one branch with successive commits.
- implements 3 commands:
	* python vc.py commit comment :
	  - checks if there is a repository in or above this directory.
	  - if not, creates repository in current directory.
	  - stores all the changes into the repository.
	  - includes all files and directories.
	  - if a file is deleted, it is kept in history.
	  - if a subdirectory is deleted, it is kept in history.
	  - returns a new version number, starting from 1.
	* python vc.py list [verbose]:
	  - prints the list of all commits (number, date + comment) in reverse order.
	  - if verbose is set, also prints the list of added/deleted/modified files+directories.
	* python vc.py revert [number/cur] [file/directory]:
	  - if number is "cur", overwrites changes and reverts to last commit.
	  - else, if any changes are not committed, refuses to do anything.
	  - if number is not specified reverts the repository to the N-1 commit (if no number is specified)
	  - else, to commit of specified number.
	  - can be framed to use a single file/files or directory/ies using a regular expression.
	  
- does handle text files with a "diff" system, data files as binary blobs.
- data stored textually if possible to ease backups.
- a mechanism needs to be implemented to minimize database corruption in case of commit interruption.


the database
------------

A directory named REPO

stores:
- a mirror of the tree under subdirectory DATA:
  - all the directories, whether created or deleted (this info is stored in metadata)
- for each file:
  - text file:
    * copy of the last version of the file preceded by ET<rev>- (latest revision) or D<rev>- (if deleted)
    * a list of deltas (+/- lines) in reverse order to reconstruct previous revisions, same file name with HT<rev>- for each delta.
  - binary file, every time the file changes a new copy is stored.
    * latest version preceded with EB<rev>- (latest revision) or D<rev>- (if deleted)
    * copies preceded with HB<rev>-
- metadata:
  * a text file listing the commits, with additions and deletions: commits.txt
  * a text file listing all the directories, and for each directory, the succession of revisions where the directory was created, (deleted, recreated, ...): metadatadir.txt

stages of a commit
------------------

during a commit:

a) check if there are new or deleted directories:

- if new directory, the directory is created in the tree
- if deleted directory, all files in the hierarchy move to D<rev>- status
- for both scenarios, the list of directories is checked and amended with latest information (creation revision or deletion revision)

b) check if there are new or deleted files:

- if new files, copy file into tree as ET<rev>- or EB<rev>-
- if deleted files, create an empty D<rev>- with the filename.

c) check if there are modified files:

- check file type:
  * if file is binary, and previous revision is also binary:
      * store previous revision in HB<prev>- where rev remains the same as EB<prev>-
      * store new bin file as EB<rev>
  * if file is text, and previous revision is also text:
      * calculate the delta that enables to create the previous revision ET<prev>- from current revision 
      * store the delta into HT<prev>- 
      * save new file as ET<rev>- 
  * if file is binary, and previous revision was text:
      * calculate the delta from an empty file to ET<prev>- and store it into HT<prev>-
      * store new file into EB<rev>-
  * if file is text, and previous revision was binary:
      * move previous revision to HB<prev>-
      * copy new file into ET<rev>- 


stages of a revert
------------------

during a revert to revision X:

a) check if there are any modifications to the repository. If they are any, stop (list them?).

b) delete the files and directories to be reverted.

c) restore the directories from the tree:

- create all directories that are "created" according to the directory metadata

d) restore the files from the tree:

- for each file in the directories created above, browse file history in reverse to create file as it appeared in revision X:
  (or revision < X if the file was not committed in revision X)
  * take last revision, copy into file. Note format (binary or text). cur := Last revision
  * for each N >= 1 and < cur, going in reverse:
    * check if exist HB<N>- / HT<N>- / D<N>-
    * if yes:
        * if revN is text and cur is binary --> restore data from HT<N>- by comparing to an empty file, overwrite cur with this data.
        * if revN is binary and cur is text, or N is binary and cur is binary --> overwrite file with HB<N>-
        * if revN and cur are text --> calculate old revision by comparing delta to cur, and overwrite cur with the result.
        * if revN is Deleted (D<N> exists) --> delete cur.
        * cur := N
        * if cur <= X ; stop the loop.

Let's first implement the directories organization.
